# 8-Bit-Battle
This is a basic pvp fighting game.
There are three modes of play including story mode, quick play and pvp battle.  
# Play Modes
First choose a play mode.  During story mode and quick play all characters are chosen at random.  In pvp mode, each player will be prompted to select a character.  I suggest you start with Bit-Man V.1 as he is beginner friendly. 
# Characters 
There are multiple characters to choose from and each character has different strengths and weaknesses including different starting health, different speeds, and different attacks.  Each player will be prompted to choose a character and then play begins.  
# Controls
Player 1 will use the arrow keys to move left and right, the down arrow key to shield and the up arrow key to jump.  Player two will use the WASD keys instead of the arrow keys.  
Player 1 will use the space bar to shoot, the M key does normal attacks and the N key does the Special Attacks.  For Player 2 the Tab key will shoot, the 2 key is normal attacks and the 1 key is special attacks. 
# Attacks
Each character's gun delivers a different amount of damage and varies in things such as load speed and shooting distance.  Botman prefers close quarters combat and has opted to never load his gun. 
All characters have the same normal attacks but each of the attacks have slightly different properties and deliver different damages.  These attacks are the punch and the kick.  The punch does less damage and has a smaller range than the kick, but is delieverd at a faster speed. If you are standing still when delivering a normal attack you will punch.  If you are moving forward while delievering a normal attack you kick.  
Each character has two special attacks.  If you are on the ground when you make a special attack you will preform an anti-air which will cause your character to punch upwards and produce a lot of damage.  If you are in the air when doing a special attack you will preform a strike.  All characters strike attack is unique to them.   For example Copy's strike is the most efficient way for him to get places.
# Beware of Lava
One either end of the screen are small pools of lava.  If a player lands in the lava thier game is automatically over and the other player is declared the winner.  Beware of other players using thier attacks to push you into the lava.  For example Quinn's strike has been known to burn his opponents to a crisp and while Botman chooses not to use a gun, you want to be weary of him getting too close when you are near lava. 
# Victory
Assuming no player touches lava, the first player to loose all of thier health will die and the opponent will be declared the winner.  Don't be fooled by the starting health because even though BitMan V2 has the lowest starting health, his attacks can easily make up for it.
